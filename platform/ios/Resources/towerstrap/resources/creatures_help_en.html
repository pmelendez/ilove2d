<img src="creature4.bmp" alt=" ROUGH" />
<p>This is the easiest intruder to kill. Without any special abilities. Moving speed is equal to 1.</p> 
<br />
<img src="creature0.bmp" alt=" GANG" />
<p>Many intruders move as a group almost one over another. Their count is between 5 and 10 intruders even that you can't see all of them.
Most effective towers against them are the "Rocket luncher", "Canon" and "Earthquake".</p> 
<br />
<img src="creature3.bmp" alt=" QUICKEN" />       
<p>Fastest intruder among all but with the least live. "Shock" and "Sniper" are the best defense.</p>
<br />
<img src="creature5.bmp" alt=" UFO" />       
<p>This is only intruder that flies, and it directs in a straight line to the exit. Most effective defense is the special "Flying Tower", but they could be attacked by "Sniper" and "Shock" too. The rest of the towers are not threat for them.</p>
<br />
<img src="creature1.bmp" alt=" GREASY" />         
<p>Big and hard to kill creature. Moves slow with a lot of live. Upgraded towers are best defense.</p>
<br />
<img src="creature2.bmp" alt=" BOMBER" />        
<p>When the Bomber dies, it blows away every creature nearby. The detonation throws a creature so hard that it could pass between towers.</p>
<br />
<img src="creature6.bmp" alt=" ICY" />          
<p>Everything that touches Icy will freeze. The tower will turn into ice and will not shoot until Icy is passing by.</p>
<br />
<img src="unvisible_creature.bmp" alt=" GHOST" />          
<p>The same as the ROUGH with the special ability of invisibility. Only Radar tower makes them visible for all other towers. When they go out of Rader range they become invisible again.</p>
<br />
<img src="creature7.bmp" alt=" BOSS" />          
<p>This is the strongest intruder. It appears surprisingly and makes your defense harder. Moves slowly with a lot of live and really difficult to be stopped. If you destroy them successfully, you will be payed well.</p>
